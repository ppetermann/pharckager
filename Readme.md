# Pharckager

A tool similar to phar-composer, so similar, that i even stole code!

On a more serious note: this is heavy based on [phar-composer](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer) by clue, 
and right now most of the code is code i stripped from phar-composer and have lightly modified to fall in with my own 
command runner (opposed to the (probably better) symfony one that the original phar-composer is using).

Now I could probably just have included phar-composer as a dependency at the current stage, but the plan is to make 
some heavy modifications, and i will break compatibility (a lot). For now if you want a tool like this, head over to 
clue's github, and grab phar-composer from there. While this might or might not work, it is most certainly not ready 
to use yet.
